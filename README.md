# üè† k3s-Homelab

This repo contains all of the configuration and documentation of my Kubernetes homelab.

Most of the homelab work is documented on my [blog](https://dominicgerman.com/blog?tag=homelab)

The purpose of my homelab is to learn new technologies and self-host some useful applications. As an IT professional, my homelab is the place where I can try out and learn new things without bringing down production. On the other hand, by self-hosting some applications, it makes me feel responsible for the entire process of deploying and maintaining an application from A to Z. It forces me to think about backup strategies, security, scalability and the ease of deployment and maintenance.
